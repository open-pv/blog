The obvious source is the direct radiation, meaning the light coming directly from the sun. The second source is the diffuse radiation, ie the radiation which is reflected by air particles and then hitting the PV panel. Hence, the blue of the sky is the second source of energy for PV systems.</p>", "image": null, "date_published": "2024-04-17T00:00:00+00:00", "authors": [{"name": "Florian Kotthoff"}], "tags": []}]}
