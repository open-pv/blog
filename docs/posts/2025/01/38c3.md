# OpenPV at the 38th Chaos Communication Congress
This years 38c3, the conference of the Chaos Communication Club, took place in Hamburg from 27th to 30th of december, 2024. From OpenPV, both [@magro](https://muenchen.social/@magro) and me ([@floko](https://mastodon.energy/@floko)) joined this conference. We presented OpenPV at the congress at the very first evening. You can find our talk on

All in all, we received great feedback from the community. It's just nice to see people interact with the website we have built. At the meetup space from [bits and baeume](https://bits-und-baeume.org/) we could also discuss sustainabilty topics and actions with other developers. The congress is just a great place with great people and awesome talks. I hope to be there this year again.
